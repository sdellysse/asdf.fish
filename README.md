# `asdf.fish`: `asdf` via `fisher`

## Install:

    fisher add shawndellysse/asdf.fish

`asdf.fish` will install `asdf` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/asdf`, `~/.adsfrc` will be
located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/asdfrc`

Right now everything just works, will add more features (if needed) in time; if
I missed something open an issue or a PR
